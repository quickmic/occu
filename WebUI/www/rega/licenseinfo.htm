Conveying Non-Source Forms.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms</p><p class="P52">of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the</p><p class="P52">machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,</p><p class="P52">in one of these ways:</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</p><p class="P52">    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the</p><p class="P52">    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium</p><p class="P52">    customarily used for software interchange.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</p><p class="P52">    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a</p><p class="P52">    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as</p><p class="P52">    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product</p><p class="P52">    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a</p><p class="P52">    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the</p><p class="P52">    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical</p><p class="P52">    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no</p><p class="P52">    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this</p><p class="P52">    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the</p><p class="P52">    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the</p><p class="P52">    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This</p><p class="P52">    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and</p><p class="P52">    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord</p><p class="P52">    with subsection 6b.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated</p><p class="P52">    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the</p><p class="P52">    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no</p><p class="P52">    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the</p><p class="P52">    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to</p><p class="P52">    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source</p><p class="P52">    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)</p><p class="P52">    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain</p><p class="P52">    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the</p><p class="P52">    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the</p><p class="P52">    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is</p><p class="P52">    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided</p><p class="P52">    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding</p><p class="P52">    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no</p><p class="P52">    charge under subsection 6d.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded</p><p class="P52">from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be</p><p class="P52">included in conveying the object code work.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any</p><p class="P52">tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,</p><p class="P52">or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation</p><p class="P52">into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,</p><p class="P52">doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular</p><p class="P52">product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a</p><p class="P52">typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status</p><p class="P52">of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user</p><p class="P52">actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product</p><p class="P52">is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial</p><p class="P52">commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent</p><p class="P52">the only significant mode of use of the product.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,</p><p class="P52">procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install</p><p class="P52">and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from</p><p class="P52">a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must</p><p class="P52">suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object</p><p class="P52">code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because</p><p class="P52">modification has been made.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or</p><p class="P52">specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as</p><p class="P52">part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the</p><p class="P52">User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a</p><p class="P52">fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the</p><p class="P52">Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied</p><p class="P52">by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply</p><p class="P52">if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install</p><p class="P52">modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has</p><p class="P52">been installed in ROM).</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a</p><p class="P52">requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates</p><p class="P52">for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for</p><p class="P52">the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a</p><p class="P52">network may be denied when the modification itself materially and</p><p class="P52">adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and</p><p class="P52">protocols for communication across the network.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,</p><p class="P52">in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly</p><p class="P52">documented (and with an implementation available to the public in</p><p class="P52">source code form), and must require no special password or key for</p><p class="P52">unpacking, reading or copying.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  7. Additional Terms.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this</p><p class="P52">License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.</p><p class="P52">Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall</p><p class="P52">be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent</p><p class="P52">that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions</p><p class="P52">apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately</p><p class="P52">under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by</p><p class="P52">this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option</p><p class="P52">remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of</p><p class="P52">it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own</p><p class="P52">removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place</p><p class="P52">additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,</p><p class="P52">for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you</p><p class="P52">add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of</p><p class="P52">that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the</p><p class="P52">    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or</p><p class="P52">    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal</p><p class="P52">    Notices displayed by works containing it; or</p><p class="P52"/><p class="P52">    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or</p><p class="P52">    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in</p><p class="P52">    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or</p><p class="P52">    authors of the material; or</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some</p><p class="P52">    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that</p><p class="P52">    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of</p><p class="P52">    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for</p><p class="P52">    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on</p><p class="P52">    those licensors and authors.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further</p><p class="P52">restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you</p><p class="P52">received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is</p><p class="P52">governed by this License along with a term that is a further</p><p class="P52">restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains</p><p class="P52">a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this</p><p class="P52">License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms</p><p class="P52">of that license document, provided that the further restriction does</p><p class="P52">not survive such relicensing or conveying.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you</p><p class="P52">must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the</p><p class="P52">additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating</p><p class="P52">where to find the applicable terms.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the</p><p class="P52">form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;</p><p class="P52">the above requirements apply either way.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  8. Termination.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly</p><p class="P52">provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or</p><p class="P52">modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under</p><p class="P52">this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third</p><p class="P52">paragraph of section 11).</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your</p><p class="P52">license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)</p><p class="P52">provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and</p><p class="P52">finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright</p><p class="P52">holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means</p><p class="P52">prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is</p><p class="P52">reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the</p><p class="P52">violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have</p><p class="P52">received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that</p><p class="P52">copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after</p><p class="P52">your receipt of the notice.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the</p><p class="P52">licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under</p><p class="P52">this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently</p><p class="P52">reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same</p><p class="P52">material under section 10.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or</p><p class="P52">run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work</p><p class="P52">occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission</p><p class="P52">to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,</p><p class="P52">nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or</p><p class="P52">modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do</p><p class="P52">not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a</p><p class="P52">covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically</p><p class="P52">receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and</p><p class="P52">propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible</p><p class="P52">for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an</p><p class="P52">organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an</p><p class="P52">organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered</p><p class="P52">work results from an entity transaction, each party to that</p><p class="P52">transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever</p><p class="P52">licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could</p><p class="P52">give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the</p><p class="P52">Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if</p><p class="P52">the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the</p><p class="P52">rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may</p><p class="P52">not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of</p><p class="P52">rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation</p><p class="P52">(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that</p><p class="P52">any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for</p><p class="P52">sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  11. Patents.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this</p><p class="P52">License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The</p><p class="P52">work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims</p><p class="P52">owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or</p><p class="P52">hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted</p><p class="P52">by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,</p><p class="P52">but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a</p><p class="P52">consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For</p><p class="P52">purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant</p><p class="P52">patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of</p><p class="P52">this License.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free</p><p class="P52">patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to</p><p class="P52">make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and</p><p class="P52">propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express</p><p class="P52">agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent</p><p class="P52">(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to</p><p class="P52">sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a</p><p class="P52">party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a</p><p class="P52">patent against the party.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,</p><p class="P52">and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone</p><p class="P52">to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a</p><p class="P52">publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,</p><p class="P52">then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so</p><p class="P52">available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the</p><p class="P52">patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner</p><p class="P52">consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent</p><p class="P52">license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have</p><p class="P52">actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the</p><p class="P52">covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work</p><p class="P52">in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that</p><p class="P52">country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or</p><p class="P52">arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a</p><p class="P52">covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties</p><p class="P52">receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify</p><p class="P52">or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license</p><p class="P52">you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered</p><p class="P52">work and works based on it.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within</p><p class="P52">the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is</p><p class="P52">conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are</p><p class="P52">specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered</p><p class="P52">work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is</p><p class="P52">in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment</p><p class="P52">to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying</p><p class="P52">the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the</p><p class="P52">parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory</p><p class="P52">patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work</p><p class="P52">conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily</p><p class="P52">for and in connection with specific products or compilations that</p><p class="P52">contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,</p><p class="P52">or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting</p><p class="P52">any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may</p><p class="P52">otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  12.

be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is</p><p class="P52">the same as in the ordinary license.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that</p><p class="P52">they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a</p><p class="P52">program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without</p><p class="P52">changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is</p><p class="P52">analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in</p><p class="P52">a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a</p><p class="P52">derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License</p><p class="P52">treats it as such.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General</p><p class="P52">Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software</p><p class="P52">sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We</p><p class="P52">concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the</p><p class="P52">users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the</p><p class="P52">libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to</p><p class="P52">permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while</p><p class="P52">preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free</p><p class="P52">libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve</p><p class="P52">this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards</p><p class="P52">changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this</p><p class="P52">will lead to faster development of free libraries.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</p><p class="P52">modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a</p><p class="P52">"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The</p><p class="P52">former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only</p><p class="P52">works together with the library.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary</p><p class="P52">General Public License rather than by this special one.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</p><p class="P52">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  0.

A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the</p><p class="P52">Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or</p><p class="P52">linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a</p><p class="P52">work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and</p><p class="P52">therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library</p><p class="P52">creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it</p><p class="P52">contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the</p><p class="P52">library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.</p><p class="P52">Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file</p><p class="P52">that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a</p><p class="P52">derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.</p><p class="P52">Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be</p><p class="P52">linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The</p><p class="P52">threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data</p><p class="P52">structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline</p><p class="P52">functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object</p><p class="P52">file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative</p><p class="P52">work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the</p><p class="P52">Library will still fall under Section 6.)</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may</p><p class="P52">distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.</p><p class="P52">Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,</p><p class="P52">whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or</p><p class="P52">link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a</p><p class="P52">work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work</p><p class="P52">under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit</p><p class="P52">modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse</p><p class="P52">engineering for debugging such modifications.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the</p><p class="P52">Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by</p><p class="P52">this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work</p><p class="P52">during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the</p><p class="P52">copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference</p><p class="P52">directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one</p><p class="P52">of these things:</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding</p><p class="P52">    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever</p><p class="P52">    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under</p><p class="P52">    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked</p><p class="P52">    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that</p><p class="P52">    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the</p><p class="P52">    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified</p><p class="P52">    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood</p><p class="P52">    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the</p><p class="P52">    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application</p><p class="P52">    to use the modified definitions.)</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at</p><p class="P52">    least three years, to give the same user the materials</p><p class="P52">    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more</p><p class="P52">    than the cost of performing this distribution.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy</p><p class="P52">    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above</p><p class="P52">    specified materials from the same place.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these</p><p class="P52">    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the</p><p class="P52">Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for</p><p class="P52">reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,</p><p class="P52">the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally</p><p class="P52">distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major</p><p class="P52">components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on</p><p class="P52">which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies</p><p class="P52">the executable.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license</p><p class="P52">restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally</p><p class="P52">accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot</p><p class="P52">use both them and the Library together in an executable that you</p><p class="P52">distribute.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the</p><p class="P52">Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library</p><p class="P52">facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined</p><p class="P52">library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on</p><p class="P52">the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise</p><p class="P52">permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work</p><p class="P52">    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library</p><p class="P52">    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the</p><p class="P52">    Sections above.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact</p><p class="P52">    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining</p><p class="P52">    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute</p><p class="P52">the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any</p><p class="P52">attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or</p><p class="P52">distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your</p><p class="P52">rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,</p><p class="P52">or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses</p><p class="P52">terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</p><p class="P52">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</p><p class="P52">distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are</p><p class="P52">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</p><p class="P52">modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the</p><p class="P52">Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</p><p class="P52">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</p><p class="P52">the Library or works based on it.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the</p><p class="P52">Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</p><p class="P52">original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library</p><p class="P52">subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</p><p class="P52">restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.</p><p class="P52">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to</p><p class="P52">this License.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</p><p class="P52">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</p><p class="P52">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</p><p class="P52">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</p><p class="P52">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</p><p class="P52">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</p><p class="P52">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</p><p class="P52">may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent</p><p class="P52">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by</p><p class="P52">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</p><p class="P52">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</p><p class="P52">refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any</p><p class="P52">particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,</p><p class="P52">and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</p><p class="P52">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</p><p class="P52">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</p><p class="P52">integrity of the free software distribution system which is</p><p class="P52">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</p><p class="P52">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</p><p class="P52">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</p><p class="P52">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</p><p class="P52">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</p><p class="P52">impose that choice.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</p><p class="P52">be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in</p><p class="P52">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</p><p class="P52">original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add</p><p class="P52">an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,</p><p class="P52">so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus</p><p class="P52">excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if</p><p class="P52">written in the body of this License.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new</p><p class="P52">versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.</p><p class="P52">Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,</p><p class="P52">but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library</p><p class="P52">specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and</p><p class="P52">"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and</p><p class="P52">conditions either of that version or of any later version published by</p><p class="P52">the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a</p><p class="P52">license version number, you may choose any version ever published by</p><p class="P52">the Free Software Foundation.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free</p><p class="P52">programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,</p><p class="P52">write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is</p><p class="P52">copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free</p><p class="P52">Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our</p><p class="P52">decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status</p><p class="P52">of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing</p><p class="P52">and reuse of software generally.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">                            NO WARRANTY</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  15.

Preamble</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</p><p class="P52">freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</p><p class="P52">Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change</p><p class="P52">free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some</p><p class="P52">specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the</p><p class="P52">Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You</p><p class="P52">can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether</p><p class="P52">this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better</p><p class="P52">strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,</p><p class="P52">not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that</p><p class="P52">you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge</p><p class="P52">for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get</p><p class="P52">it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of</p><p class="P52">it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do</p><p class="P52">these things.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</p><p class="P52">distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these</p><p class="P52">rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for</p><p class="P52">you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis</p><p class="P52">or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave</p><p class="P52">you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source</p><p class="P52">code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide</p><p class="P52">complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them</p><p class="P52">with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling</p><p class="P52">it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the</p><p class="P52">library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal</p><p class="P52">permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that</p><p class="P52">there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is</p><p class="P52">modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know</p><p class="P52">that what they have is not the original version, so that the original</p><p class="P52">author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be</p><p class="P52">introduced by others.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of</p><p class="P52">any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot</p><p class="P52">effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a</p><p class="P52">restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that</p><p class="P52">any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be</p><p class="P52">consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the</p><p class="P52">ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser</p><p class="P52">General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and</p><p class="P52">is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use</p><p class="P52">this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those</p><p class="P52">libraries into non-free programs.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using</p><p class="P52">a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a</p><p class="P52">combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary</p><p class="P52">General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the</p><p class="P52">entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General</p><p class="P52">Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with</p><p class="P52">the library.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it</p><p class="P52">does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General</p><p class="P52">Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less</p><p class="P52">of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages</p><p class="P52">are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many</p><p class="P52">libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain</p><p class="P52">special circumstances.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to</p><p class="P52">encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes</p><p class="P52">a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be</p><p class="P52">allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free</p><p class="P52">library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this</p><p class="P52">case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free</p><p class="P52">software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free</p><p class="P52">programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of</p><p class="P52">free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in</p><p class="P52">non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU</p><p class="P52">operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating</p><p class="P52">system.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the</p><p class="P52">users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is</p><p class="P52">linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run</p><p class="P52">that program using a modified version of the Library.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</p><p class="P52">modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a</p><p class="P52">"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The</p><p class="P52">former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must</p><p class="P52">be combined with the library in order to run.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</p><p class="P52">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the</p><p class="P52">Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library</p><p class="P52">facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined</p><p class="P52">library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on</p><p class="P52">the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise</p><p class="P52">permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work</p><p class="P52">    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library</p><p class="P52">    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the</p><p class="P52">    Sections above.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact</p><p class="P52">    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining</p><p class="P52">    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute</p><p class="P52">the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any</p><p class="P52">attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or</p><p class="P52">distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your</p><p class="P52">rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,</p><p class="P52">or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses</p><p class="P52">terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</p><p class="P52">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</p><p class="P52">distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are</p><p class="P52">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</p><p class="P52">modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the</p><p class="P52">Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</p><p class="P52">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</p><p class="P52">the Library or works based on it.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  10.

Conveying Non-Source Forms.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms</p><p class="P52">of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the</p><p class="P52">machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,</p><p class="P52">in one of these ways:</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">    a) Convey the

class="P52">    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a</p><p class="P52">    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as</p><p class="P52">    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product</p><p class="P52">    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a</p><p class="P52">    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the</p><p class="P52">    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical</p><p class="P52">    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no</p><p class="P52">    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this</p><p class="P52">    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the</p><p class="P52">    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the</p><p class="P52">    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This</p><p class="P52">    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and</p><p class="P52">    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord</p><p class="P52">    with subsection 6b.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated</p><p class="P52">    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the</p><p class="P52">    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no</p><p class="P52">    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the</p><p class="P52">    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to</p><p class="P52">    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source</p><p class="P52">    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)</p><p class="P52">    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain</p><p class="P52">    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the</p><p class="P52">    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the</p><p class="P52">    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is</p><p class="P52">    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided</p><p class="P52">    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding</p><p class="P52">    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no</p><p class="P52">    charge under subsection 6d.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded</p><p class="P52">from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be</p><p class="P52">included in conveying the object code work.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  A "User Product" is

designed or sold for incorporation</p><p class="P52">into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,</p><p class="P52">doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular</p><p class="P52">product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a</p><p class="P52">typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status</p><p class="P52">of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user</p><p class="P52">actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product</p><p class="P52">is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial</p><p class="P52">commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent</p><p class="P52">the only significant mode of use of the product.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,</p><p class="P52">procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install</p><p class="P52">and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from</p><p class="P52">a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must</p><p class="P52">suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object</p><p class="P52">code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because</p><p class="P52">modification has been made.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or</p><p class="P52">specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as</p><p class="P52">part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the</p><p class="P52">User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a</p><p class="P52">fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the</p><p class="P52">Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied</p><p class="P52">by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply</p><p class="P52">if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install</p><p class="P52">modified object code on the User

Termination.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly</p><p class="P52">provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or</p><p class="P52">modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under</p><p class="P52">this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third</p><p class="P52">paragraph of section 11).</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your</p><p class="P52">license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)</p><p class="P52">provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and</p><p class="P52">finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright</p><p class="P52">holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means</p><p class="P52">prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is</p><p class="P52">reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the</p><p class="P52">violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have</p><p class="P52">received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that</p><p class="P52">copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after</p><p class="P52">your receipt of the notice.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the</p><p class="P52">licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under</p><p class="P52">this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently</p><p class="P52">reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same</p><p class="P52">material under section 10.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or</p><p class="P52">run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work</p><p class="P52">occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission</p><p class="P52">to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,</p><p class="P52">nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or</p><p class="P52">modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do</p><p class="P52">not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a</p><p class="P52">covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically</p><p class="P52">receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and</p><p class="P52">propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible</p><p class="P52">for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an</p><p class="P52">organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an</p><p class="P52">organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered</p><p class="P52">work results from an entity transaction, each party to that</p><p class="P52">transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever</p><p class="P52">licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could</p><p class="P52">give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the</p><p class="P52">Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if</p><p class="P52">the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the</p><p class="P52">rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may</p><p class="P52">not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of</p><p class="P52">rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation</p><p class="P52">(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that</p><p class="P52">any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for</p><p class="P52">sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  11. Patents.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this</p><p class="P52">License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The</p><p class="P52">work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims</p><p class="P52">owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or</p><p class="P52">hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted</p><p class="P52">by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,</p><p class="P52">but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a</p><p class="P52">consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For</p><p class="P52">purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant</p><p class="P52">patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of</p><p class="P52">this License.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free</p><p class="P52">patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to</p><p class="P52">make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and</p><p class="P52">propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express</p><p class="P52">agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent</p><p class="P52">(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to</p><p class="P52">sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a</p><p class="P52">party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a</p><p class="P52">patent against the party.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,</p><p class="P52">and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone</p><p class="P52">to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a</p><p class="P52">publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,</p><p class="P52">then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so</p><p class="P52">available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the</p><p class="P52">patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner</p><p class="P52">consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent</p><p class="P52">license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have</p><p class="P52">actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the</p><p class="P52">covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work</p><p class="P52">in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that</p><p class="P52">country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or</p><p class="P52">arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a</p><p class="P52">covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties</p><p class="P52">receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify</p><p class="P52">or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license</p><p class="P52">you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered</p><p class="P52">work and works based on it.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within</p><p class="P52">the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is</p><p class="P52">conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are</p><p class="P52">specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered</p><p class="P52">work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is</p><p class="P52">in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment</p><p class="P52">to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying</p><p class="P52">the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the</p><p class="P52">parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory</p><p class="P52">patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work</p><p class="P52">conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily</p><p class="P52">for and in connection with specific products or compilations that</p><p class="P52">contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,</p><p class="P52">or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p><p class="P52"/><p class="P52">  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting</p><p class="P52">any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may</p><p class="P52">otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</p><p class="P52">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</p><p class="P52">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a</p><p class="P52">covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</p><p class="P52">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may</p><p class="P52">not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you</p><p class="P52">to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey</p><p class="P52">the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this</p><p class="P52">License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have</p><p class="P52">permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed</p><p class="P52">under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single</p><p class="P52">combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this</p><p class="P52">License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,</p><p class="P52">but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,</p><p class="P52">section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the</p><p class="P52">combination as such.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  14.

Disclaimer of Warranty.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY</p><p class="P52">APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT</p><p class="P52">HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY</p><p class="P52">OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,</p><p class="P52">THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR</p><p class="P52">PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM</p><p class="P52">IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF</p><p class="P52">ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p><p class="P52"> </p><p class="P52">  16.

Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any</p><p class="P1">format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used</p><p class="P1">for producing a compiler intermediate representation.</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in</p><p class="P1">non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in</p><p class="P1">Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,</p><p class="P1">use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered</p><p class="P1">part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be</p><p class="P1">understood as starting with the output of the generators or</p><p class="P1">preprocessors.</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or</p><p class="P1">with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any</p><p class="P1">work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to</p><p class="P1">optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an</p><p class="P1">Eligible Compilation Process.</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">1.
